for help, **do not send us e-mail asking for support or drivers**.

Modems reported to work as Ethernet devices
-------------------------------------------

- Verizon (Pantech) 295 - Works, but fails if detached and reattached,
  must reboot.
- ZTE MF60 3g
- ZTE MF90
- ZTE MF823 - Defaults to 192.168.0.1, will need to be sure local
  system does not have an overlapping network.
- ZTE MF915 LTE modem (T-Mobile)
- ZTE MF975S
- Huawei E3372h - Command to switch to the correct mode:::

    usb_modeswitch -v 12d1 -p 1f01 -c /usr/local/share/usb_modeswitch/12d1:1f01

  The command has to be executed every time it's detached and reattached,
  the interface has to be disabled and then enabled again.

- Huawei E8372h -- See :ref:`cellular-mode-switching` and `#6226
  <https://redmine.pfsense.org/issues/6226#note-2>`_


Modem variations reported to NOT work
-------------------------------------

These have the same model numbers as the above, but have different chips
and may not be supported.

- Huawei E173s

.. code::

  #Before switching (USB mass storage)
  DefaultVendor= 0x12d1
  DefaultProduct=0x1c0b
  #After switching into modem mode
  TargetVendor=  0x12d1
  TargetProductList="1c05,1c08"

- mPCIe: Sierra Wireless Gobi2000

Mode Switching
--------------

Some devices show up as a media device, such as *cd0*, in this case it
may be possible to switch modes by executing a command::

  camcontrol eject cd0

If that does switch the modem to the proper mode, it may be added as a
:doc:`/development/executing-commands-at-boot-time` using the full path::

  /sbin/camcontrol eject cd0

``usb_modeswitch`` is required in order to make certain devices switch to the
correct mode.

This package is available in the pfSense repository, but cannot be installed
using the GUI package manager. It can be installed from a shell prompt using
``pkg install usb_modeswitch``.

It's not recommended to use this method on a production firewall, as the method
has not been tested officially.
